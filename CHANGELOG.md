## TODO @memes [2.1.0] and [1.4.0] - TBD

This release contains fundamental changes to the way that data-plane interfaces
are initialised. See [CONFIGURATION](CONFIGURATION.md) for more details.

### Added

- Support for Terraform 0.14 (issue [#55](https://github.com/memes/terraform-google-f5-bigip/issues/55))

### Changed

- Non-management interface configuration is entirely configured through
  Declarative Onboarding JSON (issue [#23](https://github.com/memes/terraform-google-f5-bigip/issues/23)
  and [#26](https://github.com/memes/terraform-google-f5-bigip/issues/26))

### Removed

- `default_gateway` input variable; abusing this variable to use a management
  network gateway is not permitted via Declarative Onboarding and was always a
  work around.
