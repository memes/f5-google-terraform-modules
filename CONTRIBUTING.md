# How to contribute

We welcome contributions to this repo, but we do have a few guidelines for
contributors.

## PRs are required

All submissions, including those from project memebers, are required to go through
review. We use GitHub Pull Requests for this workflow, which should be linked with
an Issue for tracking purposes.
See [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more details.

## Pre-Commit

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to ensure that all files have
consistent formatting. Please install and integrate the tool before pushing
changes to GitHub.
