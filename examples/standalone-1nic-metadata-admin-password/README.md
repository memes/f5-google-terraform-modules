# Standalone BIG-IP (single NIC) deployment that uses a value in VM metadata to set BIG-IP admin password

**THIS EXAMPLE SETS THE ADMIN PASSWORD FROM A CLEARTEXT VALUE VISIBLE TO ANYONE
WITH ACCESS TO INSTANCE METADATA!**

> You are viewing a **2.x release** of the modules, which supports
> **Terraform 0.13** only. *For modules compatible with Terraform 0.12, use a
> 1.x release.* Functionality is identical, but separate releases are required
> due to the difference in *variable validation* between Terraform 0.12 and 0.13.

This example demonstrates how to use the
[BIG-IP module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/memes/f5-bigip/google/latest)
to deploy a single BIG-IP instance without using a secure method to retrieve admin
password at runtime. By adding a cleartext password as a metadata value, BIG-IP
can be configured even if you are not using a secret method known to the modules.
This is almost certainly NOT a good idea for anything other than a toy deployment.
Open an issue to request support for a third-party secret manager if not currently
implemented in module.

> **NOTE:** This example does not include firewall rules, ingress routes, or any
> other dependencies needed to for a fully-functional deployment. The intent is
> only to demonstrate how to *add* a single BIG-IP component to a broader
> deployment.

## Example tfvars file

* Deploy to project: `my-project-id`
* Deploy BIG-IPs to zone: `us-west1-c`
* Assign BIG-IP to VPC: `us-west1` subnet `ext-west`
* BIG-IP will use service account: `bigip@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
* BIG-IP admin user password is stored in cleartext in metadata using the key:
  `bigip-admin-password`

<!-- spell-checker: disable -->
```hcl
project_id            = "my-project-id"
zone                  = "us-west1-c"
subnet                = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project-id/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/ext-west"
service_account       = "bigip@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
secret_implementor    = "metadata"
# This value must match the metadata key containing the actual password
admin_password_key    = "bigip-admin-password"
metadata = {
    bigip-admin-password = "Sup3rS3cret#"
}
```

### Prerequisites

* VPC networks for `external` with subnet in
  region where the BIG-IP will be deployed
* Service account to be used by BIG-IP VM
* BIG-IP admin account password stored in Secret Manager, with `read` access
  granted to BIG-IP service account

### Resources created

<!-- spell-checker: ignore payg -->
* 1x VM running BIG-IP v15.1 PAYG license
